                Did someone lower the temperature? It's freezing! Oh... wait... it's snowpea!
                Plant this slick looking seed on your lawn to freeze enemies right in their tracks!

                The snowpea is a harvested plant that shoots two peas out of its mouth, knocking down
                incoming enemies, stopping at nothing to defend your lawn. It was created by Crazy Dave
                as part of the PvZ basic starter pack. Purchase and be eligible to win a 20% discount
