            <p>
                The repeater is a harvested plant that shoots two peas out of its mouth, knocking down
                incoming enemies, stopping at nothing to defend your lawn. It was created by Crazy Dave
                as part of the PvZ basic starter pack. Purchase and be eligible to win a 20% discount
                on select plants, including the Wall-Nut and Sunflower!
